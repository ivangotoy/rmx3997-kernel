RMX3997 kernel **{kernel}** for the realme 12x 5G (RMX3997, EU), built by Forgejo Actions from commit `{commit}`.

The release has two files: the AnyKernel3 ZIP and its SHA-256 checksum.

## Changes in this release

- AOSP `android13-5.15` security branch update: 54 new commits that are not
  in `android13-5.15-lts`. Most add the Android wrapfd driver
  (`drivers/android/wrapfd.c`, `CONFIG_ANDROID_WRAPFD`), which this kernel
  does not enable; its hook in `mm/mmap.c` and the `PAGE_ALIGN_DOWN` helper
  are built in. The rest are selftest build fixes.
- SUSFS stays at v2.4.0 (`fe943d15`).
