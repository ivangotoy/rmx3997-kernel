RMX3997 kernel **{kernel}** for the realme 12x 5G (RMX3997, EU), built by Forgejo Actions from commit `{commit}`.

The release has two files: the AnyKernel3 ZIP and its SHA-256 checksum.

## Changes in this release

- BBRv3 per-socket context ownership: a socket cloned from a listener no longer
  uses or frees its parent's BBRv3 state, and the BBRv3 loss hook is selected by
  a congestion-control flag instead of a name compare. Includes the hardened
  backport fixes (in-flight saturation, Reno fallback when the context cannot be
  allocated). TCP structure layouts are unchanged.
- Creating a user namespace now requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN. Root container
  launchers work as before; unprivileged processes can no longer create one.
